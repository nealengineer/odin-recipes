    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Arrabiata is a fiery and flavorful Italian pasta sauce, aptly named "angry" for its bold and spicy kick. 
        Made with tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and red chili peppers, the sauce tantalizes with a vibrant red color 
        and enticing aroma. When paired with al dente pasta, it creates a harmonious balance of tangy sweetness and 
        invigorating heat, making each bite a thrilling and unforgettable culinary experience.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
